# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Task 5 - Data Analyst Internship

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The goal is to uncover insights, patterns, and relationships in the data that may affect passenger survival.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📁 Dataset

- [Titanic Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

---

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

- Data Cleaning and Inspection (`.info()`, `.describe()`, `.value_counts()`)
- Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
- Visualizations:
  - Countplots (Survival, Gender, Class)
  - Boxplots (Age vs Survival, Fare vs Class)
  - Histograms (Age distribution)
  - Correlation Heatmap
  - Pairplots for relationship detection

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
- 1st class passengers had the best survival rate, followed by 2nd and 3rd.
- Higher fare was associated with better chances of survival.
- Age was not strongly correlated with survival, though some younger passengers did survive.
- Strong link between `Fare`, `Pclass`, and `Survival`.

---

## 📈 Output

All visualizations and final insights are included in the Jupyter Notebook file.

---

## ✅ Deliverables

- `Task5_EDA_Titanic.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with complete analysis
- (Optional) PDF export of the notebook

---

## 📬 Submission

This GitHub repository is submitted as part of **Task 5** for the **Data Analyst Internship Program**.
